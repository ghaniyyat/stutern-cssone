            <h3>Understanding HTML and CSS</h3>
            <p>
                <b>HTML</b> - <i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i>, is the language for documents that are designed to be displayed on a web browser. it is the language for describing the structure of web pages. It includes tags like html, head, title and
                body, and other element tags like headings (1-6), table, form etc.</p>
            <p>
                <b>CSS</b> - <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i>, is the language used to style an HTML document. it describes how elements should be displayed on a web page.
            </p>
            <p> There are three ways of adding CSS to an HTML document:
                <br> <b>Inline CSS</b> has the styling property written in the body section attached with element.
                <br> <b>Internal CSS</b> written in the head tag and is mostly used when to style a single html document (uniquely).
                <br> <b>External CSS</b> - this is written in a separate file with the .css extension and linked to the Html document using the <b>link</b> tag. It is mostly used to add styles across web pages.
            </p>

            <h3>Importance Of CSS</h3>
            <p>
                CSS is used for <b>styling</b> the html web page, and this basically is its importance.
            </p>
            <p> By <b>Styling</b>, this covers a whole lot. It encompasses:
                <br> <i>User Interface</i> by <b> adding colours designs, fonts and images to beautify a web page,  adding images</b>,
                <br> And sometimes <i>User Experience</i> by <b>making the webpage look meaningful</b> with the use of necessary <b>layout and format, paddings, margins</b> and even <b>border</b> to show the relativity/relation between contexts on web
                page, which without this, HTML appears clustered .
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the impotance of CSS on a web page is just as imperative as other languages used in building web pages.

            <h3>Padding, Margin and Border</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Padding</b> is the space between a content and its border, it can be regarded as the <i>inner spacing</i>, and is usually between related elements .
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Margin</b> on the other hand, is the spacing around an element's border, thus can be regarded as the <i>outer spacing</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While <b>Border</b> is the <i>container</i> wrapping an element or a content showing its visible outline.
